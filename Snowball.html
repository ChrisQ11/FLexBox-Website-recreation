    <p>
        There are escrow services out there but this one
        would be streamlined to work with our ecosystem
        One major sticking point would be that all ecosystem NFTs are guaranteed to be authentic.
        Another are flat fees or no fees. This would be too encourage
        holders to swap while preserving safety.
        To be honest I’m not sure if this would go to the public.
        I can’t think of any competitive edge this could have other than “streamlining” it for our ecosystem.
        So the question becomes what would draw holders to use our service instead of others?
        The sticking points above seem to be good options but alternatives must be considered.
